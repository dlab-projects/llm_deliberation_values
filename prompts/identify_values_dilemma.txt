<objective>
Your task is to analyze someone's evaluation of an everyday dilemma and determine what values they used in their reasoning.

The dilemma is taken from the "Am I the Asshole" community on Reddit. The evaluation assigns a verdict - one of YTA, NTA, ESH, NAH, or INFO - which determines who they think is to blame for the dilemma.
In determining who is at fault, the writer of the evaluation will invoke certain values at stake from the perspective of any number of parties in the dilemma.
The dilemma may refer to the "original poster", or "OP", who is telling the dilemma.

You have the following values to choose from. You must use these values exactly as written. Do not rephrase or invent new values. You may choose up to 5 values, total.
